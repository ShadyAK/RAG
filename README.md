# RAG-based PDF Document Retrieval and Processing

**Description:**

This project aims to build a software application that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced interaction with PDF documents. 

**What is RAG?**

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of information retrieval and large language models (LLMs). In essence, RAG allows LLMs to access and utilize relevant information from external sources (like databases, knowledge bases, or even the web) during their generation process. This significantly improves the quality and accuracy of LLM outputs by:

* **Providing access to factual information:** LLMs can access and incorporate specific facts, figures, and details from external sources, ensuring their responses are grounded in reality.
* **Improving context awareness:** By retrieving relevant information from external sources, LLMs can better understand the context of a user's query and generate more coherent and relevant responses.
* **Reducing hallucinations:** Access to external information helps LLMs avoid generating factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs, a common issue in traditional LLM-based applications.

**Project Goals:**

* **Ingest PDF documents:** Efficiently extract and store text content from PDF files.
* **Build a document database:** Create a robust and scalable database to store and manage the extracted document content.
* **Implement document chunking and parsing:** Divide large documents into smaller, more manageable chunks for efficient processing and retrieval.
* **Vectorize document content:** Create vector representations of the document chunks for efficient similarity search.
* **Develop a RAG-based interface:** Allow users to interact with the system by querying against the stored documents and receive LLM-generated responses based on the retrieved information.


**TODO List:**

* [ ] **Database Integration:**
    * [ ] Add logic to insert documents into MongoDB Atlas with dynamically generated collection names based on document metadata (e.g., document type, source).
    * [ ] Implement robust error handling and data validation during insertion.
    * [ ] Explore efficient data loading strategies for large datasets.
    * [ ] **Dependencies:** MongoDB Atlas client library.
* [ ] **Database Schema Design:**
    * [ ] Design a comprehensive database schema to effectively store and manage document metadata, content, and vector embeddings.
    * [ ] **Features:**
        * [ ] Document metadata: Title, author, source, creation date, keywords, etc.
        * [ ] Content: Chunks of text with associated metadata (e.g., page number, chunk ID).
        * [ ] Vector embeddings: Dense vector representations of each document chunk.
        * [ ] Search indexes: Create appropriate indexes for efficient querying and retrieval.
* [ ] **Document Chunking and Parsing:**
    * [ ] Implement a robust and efficient strategy to chunk large PDF documents into smaller, more manageable units.
    * [ ] **Considerations:**
        * [ ] Chunk size: Determine optimal chunk size based on LLM context window size and retrieval efficiency.
        * [ ] Chunking methods: Explore different chunking strategies (e.g., by page, by paragraph, by sentence).
        * [ ] Text cleaning and preprocessing: Implement text preprocessing steps (e.g., removing punctuation, stop words, stemming) before chunking.
* [ ] **Vector Embedding Generation:**
    * [ ] Research and experiment with different vector embedding models (e.g., Sentence-BERT, transformers) to find the most suitable model for the specific use case.
    * [ ] Determine optimal vector size: Investigate the impact of vector size on retrieval accuracy and performance.
    * [ ] Implement efficient vectorization: Optimize vectorization process for speed and resource utilization.
* [ ] **Frontend Development:**
    * [ ] Develop a minimal viable frontend (e.g., using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit) to allow users to:
        * [ ] Upload PDF documents.
        * [ ] Query the system with natural language questions.
        * [ ] View retrieved documents and LLM-generated responses.
        * [ ] Explore and visualize the relationships between documents.
